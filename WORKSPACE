# ========== LLVM & MLIR ==========

# A two-step process for buliding LLVM/MLIR with bazel. First the raw source
# code is downloaded and imported into this workspace as a git repository,
# called `llvm-raw`. Then the build files defined in the LLVM monorepo are
# overlaid using llvm_configure in the setup script below. This defines the
# @llvm-project bazel project which is can be built and depended on.
